# Clickbait Headline Generator

## About

Our website needs to trick people into looking at advertisements! But coming up with 
creative, original content is too hard. Luckily, with the clickbait headline generator, 
we can make a computer come up with millions of outrageous fake headlines. They’re all 
low quality, but readers don’t seem to mind. This program generates as many headlines 
as you need from a Mad Libs–style template.
